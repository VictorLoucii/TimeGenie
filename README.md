• Led a team project to engineer an AI-powered timetable generation system, earning certification through the Smart India Hackathon (SIH).
• Designed and implemented complex academic constraints (faculty availability, room capacity, NEP-2020 rules, electives, credits) into a quantifiable Fitness Function, solving an NP-hard optimization problem.
• Architected the complete system using Django REST API, integrating admin panels, automated data pipelines, and scalable backend logic based on SRS/DFD system documentation.
• Developed a responsive workflow enabling dynamic edits, conflict-free scheduling, and exportable timetable formats.
